#### View connected device

```sh
$ adb devices
```

If multiple devices are attached, use `adb -s DEVICE_ID` to target a specific device

<a name="list_running_services">
#### List of running services

```sh
$ adb shell dumpsys activity services
```

#### Install an app in the connected device

```sh
$ adb -s xxx.xxx.xx.xxx:5555 install Downloads/com.xxx.android.2.8.0.apk
```

#### Update an app in the connected device

```sh
$ adb -s xxx.xxx.xx.xxx:5555 install -r Downloads/com.xxx.android.2.8.0.apk
```
*the optional -r argument reinstalls and keeps any data if the application is already installed on the device. It is helpful in updating the app from current Build(1.0) to next Build(1.1)*

#### Copy file to the connected device

```sh
$ adb push Downloads/test-copy.rtf /sdcard/test-copy.txt
```

#### Fetch file from connected device

```sh
$ adb pull /sdcard/foo.txt Downloads/acd.txt
```

#### Start a remote shell

```sh
$ adb -s xxx.xxx.xx.xxx:5555 shell
```

#### Issuing single command without entering remote shell

```sh
$ adb shell ls /system/bin
```

#### Issuing monkey command

```sh
$ adb shell monkey -v -p com.xxxx.android 400
```

*Monkey is a program that runs on your emulator/device and generates random streams of user events such as clicks, touches, or gestures in the app.*

####Wireless usage

adb is usually used over USB. However, it is also possible to use over Wi-Fi, as described here.

1. Connect your Android device and adb host computer to a common Wi-Fi network accessible to both. We have found that not all access points are suitable; you may need to use an access point whose firewall is configured properly to support adb.â€¨Note: If you are attempting to connect to a Wear device, force it to connect to Wi-Fi by shutting off Bluetooth on the phone connected to it.


2. Connect the device to the host computer with a USB cable.


3. Set the target device to listen for a TCP/IP connection on port 5555.                                                    
      $ adb tcpip 5555 


4. Disconnect the USB cable from the target device.


5. Find the IP address of the Android device. For example, on a Nexus device, you can find the IP address at Settings > About tablet (or About phone) > Status > IP address. Or, on an Android Wear device, you can find the IP address at Settings > Wi-Fi Settings > Advanced > IP address.



6. Connect to the device, identifying it by IP address.        
      $ adb connect <device-ip-address>    


7.  Confirm that your host computer is connected to the target device:                                                             $ adb devices                                                               
      List of devices attached                         
      <device-ip-address>:5555 device

#### Filter by tagname in Logcat

```sh
$ adb logcat -s TAG_NAME
$ adb logcat -s TAG_NAME_1 TAG_NAME_2
```

#### Filter by priority in Logcat

```sh
$ adb logcat "*:<priority>"
# Where <priority> can be V (Verbose), D (Debug), I (Info), W (Warning), E (Error), F (Fatal), S (Silent).
```

It can be combined with tagname command, to filter by tagname and priority
```sh
$ adb logcat -s TEST: W
```

#### Filter using grep in Logcat

```sh
$ adb logcat | grep "term"
$ adb logcat | grep "term1\|term2"
```

#### Find out processor version on Android Device (check if it's an ARM, for example)

```sh
$ adb shell cat /proc/cpuinfo
```

#### Unlock screen

```sh
$ adb -s DEVICE_ID shell input keyevent 82
```
#### Use Power screen

```sh
$ adb -s DEVICE_ID shell input keyevent 26
```

#### View all installed packages

```sh
$ adb -s DEVICE_ID shell pm list packages -f
```

#### Start an activity

```sh
$ adb -s DEVICE_ID shell am start PACKAGE_NAME/ACTIVITY_IN_PACKAGE
$ adb -s DEVICE_ID shell am start PACKAGE_NAME/FULLY_QUALIFIED_ACTIVITY

Examples:
adb -s 192.168.56.101:5555 shell am start -n com.xxxx.android/.activities.MainActivity

adb -s 192.168.56.101:5555 shell am start -n com.xxxx.android/com.xxxx.android.activities.MainActivity
```


#### Launch default browser at a URL

```sh
$ adb -s DEVICE_ID shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d http://www.google.com
```

#### Taking screenshot

```sh
$ adb -s DEVICE_ID shell screencap -p | perl -pe 's/\x0D\x0A/\x0A/g' > screen.png
```
*Screenshot will be stored in you client machine from where you have executed the command. Look into the same directory from where you have executed the command.*

### Screen record
```sh
$ screenrecord [options] <filename>

Examples :
$adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/demo.mp4
```
*Stop the screen recording by pressing Ctrl-C, otherwise the recording stops automatically at three minutes or the time limit set by --time-limit.
 To begin recording your device screen, run the screenrecord command to record the video. Then, run the pull command to download the video from the device to the host computer.*
